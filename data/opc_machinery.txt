The optional 2:ProductInstanceUri is a globally unique resource identifier provided by the manufacturer of the MachineryItem. It is defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType. It is intended to uniquely identify the MachineryItem and shall not change during the life-cycle of the MachineryItem. The length is restricted to 255 characters and it is the responsibility of the manufacturer that the 2:ProductInstanceUri is globally unique. The recommended syntax of the 2:ProductInstanceUri is: <ManufacturerUri>/<any string>. The manufacturer might choose the serial number of the MachineryItem as <any string>, if the serial number is unique within the manufacturer’s scope, or a combination of model and serial number, if the serial number is only unique within a model. Examples are: “http://www.trumpf.com/A3231E001”, “http://www.kuka.com/KR210R2700_EXTRA_C4_FLR/667659”, “http://www.engelglobal.com/Viper06/235223”.

The optional 2:ManufacturerUri is a globally unique identifier of the manufacturer of the MachineryItem. It is defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType. It is intended to uniquely identify the manufacturer. It is the manufacturers responsibility to use the same identifier across its products. If the 2:ManufacturerUri is provided, it is recommended to be used as Prefix in the 2:ProductInstanceUri. As 2:ManufacturerUri is recommended to be used inside the 2:ProductInstanceUri, it shall not change during the life-cycle of the MachineryItem, even if the manufacturer changes its name, e.g. due to an acquisition. Examples are: “http://www.trumpf.com”, “http://www.kuka.com”, “http://www.engelglobal.com”.

The optional 2:Model provides a human-readable, localized name of the model of the MachineryItem. It is defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateInterfaceType. If there is no specific model, this Property should not be provided. If the physical nameplate on the MachineryItem provides a model, the Property shall be provided. It is recommended to provide a language neutral LocalizedText. Examples are “{“”,“TruLaser 5030 (L76)”}”, “{“”,“VC 200/50”}”, “{“”,”KR210R2700EXTRAC4FLR”}”, “{“”,”Viper 6”}”.

The optional 2:ProductCode provides a machine-readable string of the model of the MachineryItem, that might include options like the hardware configuration of the model. This information might be provided by the ERP system of the vendor. For example, it can be used as order information. It is defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType. If no specific information is available, the Property should not be provided. The value of this Property shall not change during the life-cycle of the MachineryItem. Examples are “11182372”, “2377636”.

The optional 2:HardwareRevision provides a string representation of the revision level of the hardware of a MachineryItem. Hardware is physical equipment, as opposed to programs, procedures, rules and associated documentation (see IEC 61499-1, [2]). The Property is defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType. Many Machines will not provide such information due to the modular and configurable nature of the Machine. The value of this Property might change during the life-cycle of a MachineryItem. Examples are: “01.33”, “A2”, “014/15120129-2018”.

The optional 2:SoftwareRevision provides a string representation of the overall software revision level of a MachineryItem. It is defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType. In most cases, MachineryItems consist of several software components. In that case, information about the software components might be provided as additional information in the AddressS pace, including individual revision information. The 2:SoftwareRevision is either not provided or provides an overall software revision level. The value of this Property might change during the life-cycle of a MachineryItem. Examples are: “PLL01 1.10.0.3” “V05.01.01.15”, “3.1 R1293”, “70.0.1”, “4.60.03”.

The optional Properties 2:DeviceRevision, 2:RevisionCounter and 2:DeviceManual defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType are not further defined in this Interface.

The optional 2:DeviceClass, defined by the 2:IVendorNameplateType, should only be used, when a companion specification defines concrete values for specific MachineryItem classes. This specification does not define any values for this Property. Examples are: “Injection Moulding Machine”, “Drilling Machine”.

The InstanceDeclarations of the IMachineryItemVendorNameplateType have additional Attribute values defined in Table 14.
