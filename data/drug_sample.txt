Ibuprofen is commonly used to reduce fever and manage pain. For oral administration in infants aged 6 months to 1 year, the recommended dosage is 5 mg/kg every 6-8 hours, with a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day. In children aged 1 to 12 years, the typical dosage is 10 mg/kg every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 40 mg/kg/day. Adolescents and adults (12 years and older) can take 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours, with a maximum of 1200 mg per day without medical supervision. For elderly patients, it is advisable to start with lower doses, such as 200 mg every 6-8 hours, due to increased risks of gastrointestinal and renal side effects, with the total daily dose not exceeding 1200 mg. Intravenous administration of ibuprofen is not typically recommended for neonates. For children aged 1 to 12 years, the recommended intravenous dosage is 10 mg/kg as a single dose, which may be repeated every 6 hours, with a maximum of 40 mg/kg/day. Adults can receive 400-800 mg intravenously every 6 hours as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 3200 mg. In elderly patients, the same dosing as adults applies, but careful monitoring is necessary due to higher sensitivity.
